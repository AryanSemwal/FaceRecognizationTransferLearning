# FaceRecognizationTransferLearning


In this code I have used two ".py" files :
1) face_recognization : this python file is used to create a model for our face recognization using transfer learning.
2) click_photo :  python file is used to automatically click images for training and testing the model. 
 
 The python code to click images uses cv2(OpenCV) modeule of pyhton.
 Transfer leraning is achieved using the pre-weighted model MobileNet using which we added our own samples and the idea of facial recognization was achieved.
